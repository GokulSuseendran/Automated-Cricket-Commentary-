# Automated-Cricket-Commentary-
The objective of the project is to generate automatic commentary for cricket videos with the help of computer vision and neural networks.\
This project contains two branches

1. Modelling
2. User-Interface
Modelling
In this folder there is Data folder and Modelling Jupyter file. In Data folder there is Images file containing link to images, Ntest.txt which is testing data, Ntrain.txt which is training data and N_token.txt which contains the image name and respective comments. For each image five different comments are written.
Modelling Part
User-Interface Three python files namely UI_final.py, model_final.py and similarity.py We are using streamlit for creating User interface. The UI_final.py file consists of the code to create user interface. In the modelling part, we get a model for image captioning, based on this model we can predict captioning for images. While playing the video frames are considered and non similar frames are captioned. That will be the output.
